## Installation
- Open [Github Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces)
- Paste the below command to deploy smart contract on Eclipse Testnet
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choir94/Eclipse-Deploy-smartcontract/main/eclipse.sh && chmod +x eclipse.sh && ./eclipse.sh
```
- Eclipse Explorer Link : [Click Here](https://explorer.dev.eclipsenetwork.xyz/?cluster=testnet)
## Note
- During creating Solana wallet, it will ask for passphrase, here you need to input a password cuz if you don't use passphrase, you will get different wallet address during importing by seed phrase
- Make sure to notedown your passphrase and keyphrase in a safe place, if they give any reward to those who deployed smart contract then u need to use this wallet to claim Airdrop

## Troubleshooting
- If you face any problem just delete existing workspace and again use the above command on fresh blank workspace
